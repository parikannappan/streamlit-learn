         "The premises around the temple had grown immensely and also the Panchayat road leading to it was elevated making the structure of the temple to go down.",
        "Due to this, whenever it rains or excess water from other nearby lakes overflows it goes into the temple. Hence the donation is for elevating the temple structure and doing a Kumbabishekam*" )
